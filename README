Simple and straightforward mixed radix DIT FFT implementation in C++11

It can do FFT of sizes:

N = 2^i * 3^j * 5^k

# make test
clang++ -stdlib=libc++ -std=c++11 -W -Wall -O3 -march=native benchmark.cc -o benchmark
./benchmark > /dev/null
FFT size: 2700
max error: 8.64283e-07
speed: 13333 ffts / sec
